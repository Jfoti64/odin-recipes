    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      
    <ul>
      <li class="odd">1 Â½ cups self-rising flour, plus more for kneading</li>
      <li class="even">1 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
      <li class="odd">cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
      <li class="odd">Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
      <li class="even">
        Mix flour and Greek yogurt together in a bowl to form a dough; 
        transfer to a work surface floured with self-rising flour. Knead dough, adding 
        more flour as needed to keep dough from being too sticky, about 8 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li class="odd">Spray a 12-inch pizza pan with cooking spray and spread dough to the edges of the pan.</li>
      <li class="even">
        Bake pizza crust in preheated oven for 5 to 7 minutes; add your favorite toppings and 
        return to the preheated oven. Bake until crust is lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes more.
      </li>
    </ol>
